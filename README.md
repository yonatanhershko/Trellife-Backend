## Technologies

The technology stack we used was MERN - MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js.
The app uses webSockets to update the board in real-time.
The API calls to the backend are done with the REST API method , and we used middlewares to authenticate and authorize actions.

We have used many thirs side libraries for many goals, such as the Chat GPT api, Unsplash, D&D and more.
The layout and pixel-perfect were made with Sass (functions, mixins, variables). 

## Getting started

Head to the repository on top and clone the project or download the files.

```
git clone https:https://github.com/yonatanhershko/Trellife.git
```

Enter the backend folder and make sure you have node_modules installed. After that we will initiate the server with 'npm start':

```
cd backend
npm i 
npm start
```

You shuold get a console ouput that the server is up and running at port 3030.
Enter the frontend folder and repeat the same process.

```
cd frontend
npm i 
npm start
```

You shuold get a console ouput that the server is up and running at localhost:3030.

That's it! The App should be opened automatically, enjoy!
